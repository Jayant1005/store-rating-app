### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v14.x or later)
*   npm (v6.x or later)
*   PostgreSQL

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Jayant1005/store-rating-app.git
    cd store-rating-app
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Database Setup

1.  **Create a PostgreSQL database:**
    *   Open `psql` and create a new database.
        ```
        CREATE DATABASE store_ratings_db;
        ```
    *   Connect to your new database:
        ```
        \c store_ratings_db
        ```

2.  **Create the necessary tables:**
    *   Run the SQL commands from the `database.sql` file (or copy-paste them from the project documentation) to create the `users`, `stores`, `ratings`, and `products` tables.

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    *   In the `backend` directory, create a file named `.env`.
    *   Add the following configuration, replacing the placeholder values with your actual database credentials:
        ```
        DB_USER=your_postgres_username
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_DATABASE=store_ratings_db
        DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
        DB_PORT=5432
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    *   Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
        ```
        node server.js
        ```
    *   The server will start on `http://localhost:5001`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    *   In a **new terminal window**, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
        ```
        npm start
        ```
    *   The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
